## Mee6 role and needed permissions

(for role setting in Discord: menu symbol next to server name=>server settings=>roles)

to let this work you need to make sure that Mee6 has `all permissions` in one of his ranks.
We could give the bot rank here all permissions and remove the Mee6 rank, it would still work the same.
